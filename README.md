## javascript developer

I have 7 years’ experience as a frontend developer specializing in JavaScript, React and rich user experiences. I’m currently playing a leading role as part of a small team building one of the largest lottery apps in the US. In the past I’ve worked on React Native apps, developed custom design systems and brought legacy codebases up to high modern standards.
