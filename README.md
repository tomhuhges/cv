## experience

### Lead Developer & Designer, Springwise
##### January 2015 - August 2016
[Springwise](https://www.springwise.com/)

| ![Springwise](https://github.com/tomhuhges/cv/blob/master/springwise.png "Springwise") | I started out as the sole developer in a small company of 5 working to improve a legacy media platform based on Wordpress, before later collaborating with various remote front end contractors and a devops team.

I developed and maintained themes across the company's 3 products - Springwise.com, Springwise Access and Springspotters - introducing Sass to better maintain CSS and git to track changes.

I maintained existing plugins (primarily WooCommerce and related extensions) and developed several custom plugins for both internal and customer-facing projects. One internal plugin worked with an mailing service API to competely automate the creation of daily and weekly newsletters. Another plugin used an algorithm to glean data from tagged articles and generate real-time insights for paying customers.

I vastly improved the company's analytics, integrating Google Analytics Ecommerce tracking, Mixpanel for tracking usage of the premium platform, and New Relic to trace errors and improve site speeds.

I worked directly with and was key to enabling custom solutions for important global clients including WPP, Oracle, Tata & Sons and the Prime Ministers Office in Dubai.

I was also leading design at Springwise, working with Adobe CC (PhotoShop, Illustrator, InDesign) to design and create assets for company identity, print and digital marketing materials. |
